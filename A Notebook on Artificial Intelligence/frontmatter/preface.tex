\chapter*{Preface}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) was included as part of the control system notebook, as in early ages it was mostly used as a system identification tool in control systems.

With the advent of graphical processing units (GPU) in the $1990$th and the Industry 4.0 initiatives in $2000$th, deep learning network with massive training data became possible, which significantly boosted the performance of artificial neural network (ANN)-based AI systems. Nowadays, AI has been growing rapidly with successful demonstrations of use cases such as computer vision and natural language processing.

Seeing that trend, AI relevant contents have been separated from the control system notebook and collected here.

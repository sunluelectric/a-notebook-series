\chapter*{Preface}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) was included as part of the control system notebook, as in early ages it was mostly used as a system identification tool to support a controller.

With the advent of graphical processing units (GPU) in the $1990$th and the Industry 4.0 initiatives in $2000$th, deep learning network with massive training data has become possible, which significantly boost the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) based AI systems. Nowadays, AI has been growing rapidly with more and more successful demonstrations of useful cases such as computer vision and natural language processing.

Seeing that trend, AI relevant contents have been split from the control system notebook, and put here.

\chapter{Decision Making}

An AI agent should be able to make decisions on what action to take based on what it believes and what it wants. The optimal action may vary depending on the current status, the objective, and the stochasticity of the environment and the system. In the essence, this is a statistics problem where the agent decides what action among all its possible actions may lead to the most beneficial consequence. 

Different decision making models are studied in this chapter.

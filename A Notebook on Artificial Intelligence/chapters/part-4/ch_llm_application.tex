\chapter{LLM-Relevant Applications}

LLM-relevant applications are introduced. They either integrate LLM in the application, or use technologies inspired by LLM.

\section{Retrieval Augmented Generation} \label{sec:retrievalaugmentedgeneration}

The idea of \mync{retrieval augmented generation}[RAG] is to integrate an LLM with a database or knowledge base. In this setup, the LLM acts as an interface to the external data source. It automatically retrieves relevant information based on the input query and incorporates that information into its response. 

RAG is an effective way to mitigate the issue of misinformation generation in LLMs, as it grounds the model's responses in factual external content rather than relying solely on its internal parameters.

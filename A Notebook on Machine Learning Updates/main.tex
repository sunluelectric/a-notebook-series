Many data companies, including Microsoft, Google, Meta (formerly known as Facebook) and Amazon, provide their own data models and AI engines of different kinds. Famous and AI engines and models include TensorFlow by Google, PyTorch by Meta, and ChatGPT by OpenAI, which is a company supported by Microsoft.

These data companies usually open (part of) the source code of these models and engines in the community and encourage individual developers to learn and use them. At the same time, they provide enterprise level services such as model fine-tuning to make profit from the tools.

Some state-of-art models, engines, as well as the business models of these companies are reviewed in this part of the notebook.

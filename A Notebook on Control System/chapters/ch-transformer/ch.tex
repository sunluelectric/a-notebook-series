\chapter{Transformer}

Transformer is a new schematic design of deep learning model which, compared with other designs such as CNN and RNN, is better at parallel training. It has become a handy tool for natural language processing and human interfacing.

In this Chapter, selected research papers on transformer are discussed. \textit{ChatGPT}, an AI chatbot that uses transformer, is introduced as an example.

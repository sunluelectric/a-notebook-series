\chapter{Model Predictive Control System} \label{ch:mpcs}

Model predictive controller belongs to the family of optimal controllers. Given the plant model and a control signal, the behavior of the system can be foreseen. MPC finds the control signal with the optimal forecast.

Comparing with other optimal controllers such as LQG, MPC has a better adaption to different kinds of restrictions. This makes MPC extremely popular in industry. From this perspective, many optimal controllers can be taken as special cases of MPC.

\section{Introduction}

The MPC uses system dynamic model to forecast system behavior, and optimize the forecast to produce the best decision at the current moment.

From the above description, we can see that the there are at least 3 key factors of MPC:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Model of the plant, both structure and parameters.
	\item The current state (initial state) of the plant model.
	\item The control signal.
\end{itemize}
where the model structure is derived from assumptions, the parameters obtained by parameter estimation, and the current state of the model obtained by state estimation. Finally, an optimization problem with varieties of restrictions is proposed to generate the control signal.

\subsection{Models}

The model in an MPC plays the most important role. Many types of models are used to describe the plant in the MPC scope.

Depending on the plant, the model can be either in continuous time domain or in discrete time domain; either state-space or input-output; either centralized or discrete (discrete models are used when the behavior of the system is not spatially uniform); and either deterministic or stochastic.

Different mathematics tools are used to describe and solve MPC problems of different types of models.

\subsection{Constraints}

MPC has a good adaption to different types of constraints. The constraints can be largely divided into two categories, namely physical constraints and performance constraints.

Input signal $u(k)$ related constraints are often physical constraints. It describes physical limits of the system. If the controller does not respect these constraints, the physics enforce them. An example of a physical constraint is the maximum input power to a motor.

State vector $x(k)$ and output $y(k)$ related constraints are often performance constraints. They describe the desirable performance of the system, and they may or may not be achievable in practice. MPC is able to find out whether the performance constraints are achievable or not. Should the performance constraints not be achievable, they need to be modified and downgraded.

Input signal related constraints are often given in the following format.
\begin{eqnarray}
	\left[\begin{array}{c}
		-I \\ I
	\end{array}\right]u(k) &\leq& \left[\begin{array}{c}
	-u_{\textup{min}} \\ u_{\textup{max}}
\end{array}\right] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

State vector related constraints are often given in the following format.
\begin{eqnarray}
	Fx(k) &\leq& f \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

When augmented state vector is used, it is possible to combine the input and the state vector together to form constraints with more flexibility. For example, let
\begin{eqnarray}
	\tilde{x}(k) &=& \left[\begin{array}{c}
		x(k) \\ u(k-1)
	\end{array}\right] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Then the following constraint
\begin{eqnarray}
	\left[\begin{array}{cc}
		0 & -I \\ 0 & I
	\end{array}\right]\tilde{x}(k) + \left[\begin{array}{c}
	I \\ -I
\end{array}\right]u(k) &\leq& \left[\begin{array}{c}
\Delta_{\textup{max}} \\ -\Delta_{\textup{min}}
\end{array}\right] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
essentially translates to
\begin{eqnarray}
	\Delta_{\textup{min}} \leq u(k) - u(k-1) \leq \Delta_{\textup{max}} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
which can become handy sometimes.

It is also possible to limit the state vector and/or the input to be integers or discrete values, which is not commonly seen in other optimal controllers.

\subsection{Simple Examples}

In this section, a linear quadratic regulator problem is used to demonstrate MPC. Notice that although LQR is often regarded as a stand alone optimal control problem, there is no harm to introduce LQR as a simplified MPC problem, just for demonstration purpose.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent \textbf{LQR Formulation}
\vspace{0.1in}

Consider the following dynamic model in discrete time domain. Current timestamp is $k=0$. For simplicity, it is assumed that the model is known and the state is measurable precisely, thus there is no need to build an estimator for the model or the state.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x(k+1) &=& Ax(k) + Bu(k) \label{eq:lqrexp1} \\
  y(k) &=& x(k) \label{eq:lqrexp2}
\end{eqnarray}

With the above model, it is possible to predict how the state evolves given a sequence of inputs as below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  u &=& \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
                u(0) & u(1) & \ldots & u(N-1) \nonumber
              \end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray}
where $N$ is the largest time scale considered in this problem.

The purpose of the control is to regulate non-zero initial state $x(0)$ to zero while keeping the magnitude of $u(k)$ small. Therefore, define the cost function as follows.
\begin{eqnarray}
  V\left(x(0), u\right) &=& \dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\left(x(k)^TQx(k) + u(k)^TRu(k)\right) + \dfrac{1}{2}x(N)^TP_fx(N) \nonumber \\ \label{eq:lqrexp3}
\end{eqnarray}
where $Q\geq 0$, $P_f \geq0$ and $R>0$ are symmetric matrices of user's choice. It can be proved that the above problem formulation must have a unique solution.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent \textbf{A Brief Introduction to Dynamic Programming}
\vspace{0.1in}

The aforementioned optimization problem in \eqref{eq:lqrexp3} can be solved via variety of ways. Consider using dynamic programming (DP). 

A brief introduction to DP is given as follows. For illustration of DP, consider the following simple optimization problem.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x^*, y^* &=& \arg\min_{x,y} f(x, y) \label{eq:dpdemo1}
\end{eqnarray}
Since $x,y$ are coupled in $f(x,y)$, an intuitive way of solving this optimization problem is to let
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}
         \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,y) & = & 0 \\
         \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}f(x,y) & = & 0
       \end{array}\right. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
and if $f(x,y)$ is quadratics of $x, y$, the above should generate a unique solution.

Alternatively, consider solving \eqref{eq:dpdemo1} using the following approach. Think of \eqref{eq:dpdemo1} as a two-stage optimization problem. Given any constant value of $y$, there is an associated optimized $x^*(y)$ which minimizes \eqref{eq:dpdemo1}. Using this method, we can transform $f(x,y)$ into $f\left(x^*(y), y\right)$, a function of $y$ alone. From there, the optimal $y$ can be found easily. Subsequently, $x^*(y)$ can be obtained as well. To summarize, \eqref{eq:dpdemo1} is equivalent of
\begin{eqnarray}
y^* &=& \arg\min_{y}\left(\min_{x}f(x,y)\right) \nonumber \\
x^* &=& \arg\min_{x} f(x, y^*) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Solving using DP as above can simplifies the problem, especially When only part of the optimal variable values is required (for example, only $y^*$ is required).

\noindent \textbf{Solution to the LQR Problem}
\vspace{0.1in}

The LQR problem in \eqref{eq:lqrexp3} is essentially something similar with \eqref{eq:dpdemo1}. The initial state $x(0)$ is a constant in the optimization problem, the control signals $u(0), ..., u(N-1)$ to be optimized, and the coupling introduced by the system dynamics \eqref{eq:lqrexp1}. The ultimate goal of the optimization problem is to determine $u(0)$.

Similarly, the optimization is divided into multiple stages, where in each stage only one instant $u(k)$ is considered, and other variables leading to that stage is considered as constant. We start with the last control input $u(N-1)$. The optimization problem is formulated as follows.
\begin{eqnarray}
  V^{\textup{sub}}(N-1) &=& \dfrac{1}{2}\left(x(N-1)^TQx(N-1) + u(N-1)^TRu(N-1)\right) \nonumber \\ && + \dfrac{1}{2}x(N)^TP_fx(N) \nonumber \\
  \textup{s.t.} && x(N) = Ax(N-1) + Bu(N-1) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $x(N-1)$ is taken as a constant from another stage. 

Solving $u(N-1)$ as a function of $x(N-1)$ gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  u^*(N-1) &=& K_{N-1}x(N-1) \nonumber \\
  x(N) &=& (A+BK_{N-1})x(N-1) \nonumber \\
  V^{\textup{sub}}(N-1) &=& \dfrac{1}{2}x(N-1)^T\Pi_{N-1}x(N-1) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $K_{N-1}$ and $\Pi_{N-1}$ are two intermediate parameters calculated as follows.
\begin{eqnarray}
K_{N-1} &=& -(B^TP_fB + R)^{-1}B^TP_fA \nonumber \\
\Pi_{N-1} &=& Q + A^TP_fA-A^TP_fB(B^TP_fB+R)^{-1}B^TP_fA \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

Consider the next stage optimization problem as follows.
\begin{eqnarray}
  V^{\textup{sub}}(N-2) &=& \dfrac{1}{2}\left(x(N-2)^TQx(N-2) + u(N-2)^TRu(N-2)\right) \nonumber \\
  \textup{s.t.} && x(N-1) = Ax(N-2) + Bu(N-2) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $x(N-2)$ is taken as constant and $u^*(N-2)$ is to be found.

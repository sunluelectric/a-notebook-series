\chapter*{Preface}

This notebook is on \textit{Algebra}. The first part of the notebook is about linear algebra, one of the first few modules a science and engineering undergraduate student would take in his first semester in the collage. It is absolutely the fundamental of almost all the mathematical tools he would use in the future. The second part of the notebook is about abstract algebra, a far more advanced topic and yet still a lot of fun to learn. 

The key reference of this notebook is listed below. During the development of the notebook, this list may become longer and longer.

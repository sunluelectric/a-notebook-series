\chapter{TensorFlow and PyTorch} \label{ch:tf} 

TensorFlow and PyTorch are very popular and powerful Python-based generic-purpose AI engines. They both cover a large range of AI applications including pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, and many more. They both offer variety of AI tools to quickly design and deploy different types of AI models such as conventional dense networks, CNN models, RNN models. Both of them can be used to train, evaluate and run networks. Both of them provide both server solutions, cloud solutions and edge computing solutions.

There was a debate on which one of the two is superior than the other. In the scope of this notebook, mastering either of them would make one a skilled developer and user in data science.

\chapter{Pandas} \label{ch:pandas}

Many Python packages provide functions to handle structured data such as tables, series, and data frames. Among all these packages, \verb|pandas| is the all-time star that is very widely used by developers and data scientists. With \verb|pandas|, Python gains the ability to easily, flexibly and efficiently deal with data frames. The \verb|pandas| package is introduced in this section.

Jupyter-lab is used in this chapter to run the Python codes. 

A large portion of this chapter, including codes and examples, are from online resources such as \textit{Data Analysis by Pandas and Python} on Udemy.

\section{Brief Introduction}

\section{Data Preprocessing}

Preprocessing of data is always required in data science. The format of data needs to be tidied, and error samples removed. Even with very clean input data, it is often necessary to do feature analysis and scaling (feature normalization). For verification of the effectiveness of the model to be built, data splitting into training set and testing set is often required.

Commonly used packages are imported as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

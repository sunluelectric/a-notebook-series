\chapter{Basic Tools} \label{ch:numpyscipy}

Python has been increasingly popular for data science in the past few years. Many libraries and tools have been developed for Python to enhance its data analysis and visualization capabilities, just to name a few, \verb|numpy|, \verb|scipy|, \verb|scikit-learn|, \verb|pandas|, \verb|matplotlib| \verb|tensorflow| and \verb|pytorch|.

This chapter together with a few consequent chapters introduces commonly used tools that data science adopts using Python. This part of the notebook is more application driven, and only the basic implementations are introduced. We are not digging into the theory supporting machine learning and artificial intelligence.

It has been increasingly popular today, to use Python together with Conda and jupyter-lab/jupyter notebook. Conda is an open-source language-agnostic package and environment management system. Jupyter notebook is an interactive computing platform for Python and other computer programming languages. The detailed introduction to the installation and usage of Conda and Jupyter notebook is not covered here. They are used when demonstrating the examples in this chapter and the consequent chapters.

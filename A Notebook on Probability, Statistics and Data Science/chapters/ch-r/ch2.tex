\chapter{R Advanced Skills} \label{ch:r2}

This chapter introduces advanced skills of R language, such as variety of tools and skills in data preparation, advanced use of list, etc.

\section{Data Preparation} \label{ch:r2:sec:datapreparation}

The data downloaded from sensors usually needs to go through pre-processing procedures such as filtering, normalization, etc., before it can be used by a controller or an AI engine.

\subsection{Data Type Conversion}

Data preparation including data tidy is one of the most tedious and time consuming parts when using R for data analysis. The section introduces useful techniques helpful with data preparation.

It is importnt that the data types of all the columns meet expectation, especially for numeric and factor (categorical) data types. Use \verb|str(<df>)| to check the column data types of a data frame, and convert data types as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}
<df>$<column> <- factor(<df>$<column>) # character/numeric to factor
<df>$<column> <- as.numeric(<df>$<column>) # character to numeric
<df>$<column> <- as.numeric(as.character(<df>$<column>)) # factor to numeric
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that when converting factor type to other types, R may deal with the factor using the underlying ``factorization integers'' instead of the factor item names. An example is given below. It can be seen that the original \verb|5.1|, after being converted to factor then back to numeric, becomes \verb|9|. This is because the factorization integer for \verb|5.1| is \verb|9|, as given by printing \verb|my_factor| to the console.

When converting factor to other types, special caution is required. To convert a factor to other types such as numeric, consider converting it to character first as given in the following example.
\begin{lstlisting}
> my_numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(my_factor))
> my_numeric
  [1] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 5.4 4.6 5.0 4.4 4.9 5.4 4.8 4.8 4.3 5.8 5.7
 [17] 5.4 5.1 5.7 5.1 5.4 5.1 4.6 5.1 4.8 5.0 5.0 5.2 5.2 4.7 4.8 5.4
 [33] 5.2 5.5 4.9 5.0 5.5 4.9 4.4 5.1 5.0 4.5 4.4 5.0 5.1 4.8 5.1 4.6
 [49] 5.3 5.0 7.0 6.4 6.9 5.5 6.5 5.7 6.3 4.9 6.6 5.2 5.0 5.9 6.0 6.1
 [65] 5.6 6.7 5.6 5.8 6.2 5.6 5.9 6.1 6.3 6.1 6.4 6.6 6.8 6.7 6.0 5.7
 [81] 5.5 5.5 5.8 6.0 5.4 6.0 6.7 6.3 5.6 5.5 5.5 6.1 5.8 5.0 5.6 5.7
 [97] 5.7 6.2 5.1 5.7 6.3 5.8 7.1 6.3 6.5 7.6 4.9 7.3 6.7 7.2 6.5 6.4
[113] 6.8 5.7 5.8 6.4 6.5 7.7 7.7 6.0 6.9 5.6 7.7 6.3 6.7 7.2 6.2 6.1
[129] 6.4 7.2 7.4 7.9 6.4 6.3 6.1 7.7 6.3 6.4 6.0 6.9 6.7 6.9 5.8 6.8
[145] 6.7 6.7 6.3 6.5 6.2 5.9
\end{lstlisting}
where \verb|my_factor| is generated previously.

It is possible for some columns in the data frame to look like a factor and a character string, but indeed should be handled as numeric values. For example, \verb|S$6,125.50| in many occasions should be treated just as \verb|6125.0|. These factor or character values cannot be converted to numeric values directly.

In such cases, consider using \verb|sub()| or \verb|gsub()| to replace patterns in a character, then convert it into numeric values. Notice that \verb|sub()| replaces only the first encounter of the pattern, while \verb|gsub()| replaces all the encounters. An example of using \verb|gsub()| is given below.
\begin{lstlisting}
> money_character <- c("S$6,273.15", "S$215.3", "S$8,987,756.00")
> typeof(money)
[1] "character"
> a <- gsub(",", "", money) # replace "," with ""
> a <- gsub("S\\$", "", a) # replace "S$" with ""
> money_numeric <- as.numeric(a)
> money_numeric
[1]    6273.15     215.30 8987756.00
> typeof(money_numeric)
[1] "double"
\end{lstlisting}
where notice that \verb|$| is a special character defined in R, and to escape from that \verb|\\$| is used. Notice that applying \verb|sub()| and \verb|gsub()| on a factor automatically converts it to character as a hidden step.

\subsection{Handling Missing Data}

There can be missing data in the data frame. There are a few ways to deal with missing data as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the missing data can be derived from other columns, derive the missing data and fill in the blanks.
	\item If the missing data does not affect the rest analysis, leave it blank.
	\item Delete the row.
	\item Use interpolations to fill in the blank.
	\item Use correlations and similarities to fill in the blank.
	\item Argument a new column add a ``data-missing'' flag to that row.
\end{itemize}

If the missing data can be derived from other columns, derive the missing data and fill in the blanks.

In R, \verb|NA| is a special variable used to indicate a missing value, and it is by itself of logical data type in addition to \verb|TURE| and \verb|FALSE|. Operations involving \verb|NA| often return \verb|NA|. Examples are given below.
\begin{lstlisting}
> typeof(NA)
[1] "logical"
> TRUE == 1 # TRUE is equivalent with 1
[1] TRUE
> TRUE == 2
[1] FALSE
> FALSE == 0 # FALSE is equivalent with 0
[1] TRUE
> FALSE == -1
[1] FALSE
> TRUE == FALSE
[1] FALSE
> NA == NA
[1] NA
> NA == TRUE
[1] NA
> NA == FALSE
[1] NA
\end{lstlisting}

Use the following to filter for all rows with/without at least one \verb|NA|.
\begin{lstlisting}
<df>[complete.cases(<df>),] # all complete rows
<df>[!complete.cases(<df>),] # all incomplete rows
\end{lstlisting}
where \verb|complete.cases(<df>)| returns a list made up of \verb|TRUE| and \verb|FALSE| indicating whether the associated row is complete or now.

Sometimes a blank string \verb|""| that we would expected to be treated as \verb|NA| is not treated as so. To fix that, while importing the data frame (say, from a CSV file), use the following
\begin{lstlisting}
df <- read.csv("<csv-name>", na.string=c("<pattern>", ...))
\end{lstlisting}
where \verb|"<pattern>"| are the patterns in the original file to be replaced by \verb|NA|, for instance, \verb|""|, \verb|"ERROR"|, etc.

\chapter{Brief Introduction to Numerical Analysis}

Numerical analysis goes beyond calculus. However, it still makes sense to include it as part of the calculus notebook. Many numerical analysis algorithms are inspired by calculus. In return, as one of the most important applications, numerical analysis is used to solve differential equations when their analytical solution is not obtainable using calculus. 

There are numerical analysis textbooks such as the latest edition of \cite{burden1997numerical} (as of this writing it is in its $10$th edition) that list ``review of calculus'' as its first section.

\section{Motivation}

Sometimes it is not possible to describe a variable or a model using analytical equations alone. For example, we may need to solve $f(x)=0$ for $x$, and there is no analytical expression of $x$ due to the complexity of $f(x)$. Or, we may need to describe the behavior of a model in the form of $f(x)$, but the true model is too difficult to calibrate precisely. In both examples, analytical solution finds its limitations.

Numerical solution serves as an alternative to the analytical solution. Though numerical solution is likely to be more computationally intensive and give less insights than the analytical solution, it finds its usefulness in many engineering problems where analytical solution is not reachable. 

Numerical analysis studies the effectiveness and efficiency of numerical solutions for variety of problems.

## üéØ Purpose & Philosophy

These notebooks are inspired by the open-source software philosophy - making knowledge freely accessible, editable, and improvable by the community. They serve as comprehensive study materials for students, researchers, and anyone interested in deepening their understanding of these fundamental subjects.

### Key Features:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each notebook covers its subject from fundamentals to advanced topics
- **Structured Learning**: Organized in logical parts and chapters with clear progression
- **Practical Examples**: Includes motivating examples, exercises, and real-world applications
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Proper definitions, theorems, and proofs where appropriate
- **Cross-Referenced**: Extensive use of references and citations to original sources

## üèóÔ∏è Structure

Each notebook follows a consistent structure:
- **Frontmatter**: Dedication, table of contents, foreword, and subject-specific preface
- **Main Content**: Organized in parts and chapters covering the subject systematically
- **References**: Comprehensive bibliography of source materials
- **Index**: Detailed index for easy navigation

All notebooks share common frontmatter elements while maintaining subject-specific prefaces that provide context and acknowledge key reference materials.

## üîß Building the Notebooks

Each notebook is a complete LaTeX document that can be compiled individually:

1. Navigate to the specific notebook directory
2. Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX)
3. Compile using: `pdflatex main.tex`
4. For complete bibliography and index: `bibtex main`, `makeindex main`, then `pdflatex main.tex` (twice)

### Dependencies
- LaTeX distribution with standard packages
- Custom style files in the `style/` directory
- Shared frontmatter in the `frontmatter/` directory
